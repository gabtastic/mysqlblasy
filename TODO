This file is a scratch board. It is not a roadmap!

TODO
- have a systematic (parseable) name for dumps
- crash safe (can cleanup a previous interupted backup session+give a notice about it)
- prefer data integrity over speed/space efficiency
- _should_ not require more modules than the standard perl modules
- database locking while dumping (cross table integrity!)
- multiple sections in config file (e.g. multiple backup runs in one run...)
- anything else?
